# generic-api-app-CMSI2022

This solo project was the 2nd of 4 completed for the LMU CMSI2022: Mobile App Development Class in Spring 2023.

The following is from my original project description:

## Food Info
### About the App
My App, Food Info, allows users to search their choice of foods and see if the FDA has ever made recalls on them in recent years. After searching, they can decide how many results they would like to see based on a slider. Once they click on one of the results, they will see a page that tells them the FDA Description, Location, starting date, status, and the infamous "Reason for Recall."

### About the API
The API I utilized, the FDA Recall List API (specifically for foods), allows searchers to gain main data and other related metadata for recalls. The API allows you to search for specific descriptions and take in limits to the responses, and after so many searches a day an API Key is required to get more (and thus I employed one).
